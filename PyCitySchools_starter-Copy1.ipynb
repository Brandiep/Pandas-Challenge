    " - When reviewing the schools based on best and worst performance, it’s quite clear that charter schools take the lead. The top 5 best performing schools are all charter schools, whereas the bottom 5 schools are all district schools. This is again confirmed when comparing the schools by type. \n",
    " - When comparing each grade within a school, there is very little difference in their math and reading scores. The scores remain consistent from 9th through 12th grade. \n",
    " - Interestingly, when comparing the spending per student, schools that spend less per student show better performance than those that spend more per student. \n",
    " - Lastly, larger schools also tend to have poor performance compared to smaller and medium sized schools. \n",
